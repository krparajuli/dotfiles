# dotfiles
This project is the configuration store for various Linux/MacOS environments and applications

It uses [dotbot(anishathalye/dotbot)](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to manage the links to the configurations. The configurations are blatantly "inspired" and copied from [JJGO/dotfiles](https://github.com/JJGO/dotfiles).
